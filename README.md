# ros_dvl_a50_driver
ROS2 driver for the WaterLinked DVL-A50. Currently work-in-progress.

# Get started
Build and run with `ros2 run dvl_a50_driver ros_dvl_a50_driver_node` :)
Currently, only ip and port are settable parameters, but they default to `192.168.194.95` and `16171` respectively, which should work out of the box with the A50.
